## Second hand car analysis

In this Python data visualization project, the focus is on processing and visualizing data from a secondary car dataset. The initial step involves loading the data file and performing data cleaning to ensure accuracy. The dataset is then subjected to various visualizations to extract insights.

A pair plot is generated to visually explore relationships between different numerical variables. A heatmap is employed to showcase correlations among these variables, aiding in identifying influential factors. Additionally, an Lmplot is created to illustrate linear relationships between key attributes.

For categorical analysis, a bar chart is crafted to display the distribution of car brands or categories, offering a quick overview of market presence. Furthermore, a histogram provides a visual depiction of the frequency distribution of a specific attribute like car prices, allowing for better understanding of pricing trends.

Lastly, a Jointplot is used to highlight bivariate relationships, assisting in uncovering patterns between two variables.

In summary, this Python project involves loading, cleaning, and visualizing secondary car data. Through pair plots, heatmaps, Lmplots, bar charts, histograms, and Jointplots, the project provides comprehensive insights into various aspects of the car dataset.
